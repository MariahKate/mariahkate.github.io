# Research

My research interests are broadly centered within Political and Cultural Sociology and Sociology of Sport.

My most recent work, co-authored with Dr. Chris Knoester and published in [_Social Currents_](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/23294965221074017), examines U.S. Adults' opinions on the appropriateness of tackle football for kids and has been featured on WebMD and US News & World Report in addition to receiving cable news coverage reaching about 70% of US households with TVs.

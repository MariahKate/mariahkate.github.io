# Research

My research interests are broadly centered within Political and Cultural Sociology and Sociology of Sport.

My most recent work, co-authored with Dr. Chris Knoester and published in [_Social Currents_](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/23294965221074017), examines [U.S. Adults' opinions on the appropriateness of tackle football for kids](https://news.osu.edu/americans-love-football-but-differ-on-whether-kids-should-play/) and has been featured on [WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/brain/news/20220404/half-of-americans-now-think-playing-football-inappropriate-for-kids-survey), [US News & World Report](https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2022-04-04/half-of-americans-now-think-playing-football-inappropriate-for-kids-survey), [Vox](https://www.vox.com/23537672/damar-hamlin-injury-nfl-football-tv-ratings), and [The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/3803182-damar-hamlin-injury-revives-safety-debate-over-a-sport-built-on-butting-heads/) in addition to receiving [local](https://www.nbc4i.com/news/local-news/ohio-state-study-50-of-americans-say-tackle-football-is-inappropriate-for-kids/) and [national](https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/sports/study-50-of-americans-say-tackle-football-inappropriate-for-kids/) cable news coverage. I also was invited to speak about the work on [WOSU 89.7 NPR News](https://news.wosu.org/show/all-sides-with-ann-fisher/2023-01-04/football-fans-question-safety-of-sport-following-damar-hamilns-collapse) and write an opinion column for [<em>The Columbus Dispatch</em>](https://www.dispatch.com/story/opinion/columns/2023/01/06/what-impact-will-damar-hamlin-injuries-have-on-youth-football-cinncinnati-bengals-buffalo-bills/69781520007/).
